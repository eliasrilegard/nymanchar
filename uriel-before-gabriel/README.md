# Uriel before Gabriel

Forces Uriel to spawn as the first angel fight of the run and Gabriel as the 2nd.

This effect only applies to rooms where you can bomb a statue to fight the angel (which to my knowledge is only angel rooms and super secret rooms), meaning e.g. the sacrifice room order isn't affected.
